67-443: BlackJack (w/ Combine)
---

This playground is a simple demo of how to use Combine to process a data stream (in this case, dealing cards).  

In the Sources folder, there is some support code for creating a card, a deck of cards, and for creating a hand of cards. 

This was moved here just so the main code could focus on the elements of Combine, such as `PassthroughSubject` and `sink`, and highlight how they work together in handling the data stream.

Finally, a little tribute to a funny Seinfeld episode. Enjoy. ðŸ˜‰
